**This specification is by no means complete**. It may and will change during development to match the project state.

Take it as a guide to get a general idea of what the software is/will be able to do, rather than a perfect definition of its current or future capabilities.

**The user descriptions portrayed in this document, as well as their names, are fictitious** and quite tongue-in-cheek, actually. If you get offended easily, please stop reading this document right now.

Overview
--

**Sprite Hut** is just a sprite editor. It **used** to *have a twist* in its description in the sense that it would allow to export not only bitmaps (image sequences and sprite sheets), but additional data useful for video game engines like texture coordinates.

As this is long overdue, *aka* it has been in *Development Hell* for quite some time now, let's get rid of some of some of the bells and whistles and provide people a useful tool to push pixels with.

 We'll revisit the *twist* part later.

User case scenarios
--

### Mona

Mona is a very special liberal-arts degree student. She dyes her hair in *vibrant* colours (at least **three**, for good measure) and uses an extremely expensive computer that she bought by mortgaging her future grandchildrens' university funds, just like every other aspiring designer in the city. "But it *was* **totally worth it**!", she yells from the end of the corridor. Yeah, sure.

She's interested in pixel art as long as it is not *too mainstream*, so right now it's a little early for her to jump off the retro bandwagon, but it's certainly starting to get crowded there. She uses **Sprite Hut** once in a while when she forgets her luxurious notebook at home and she has to use a good ol' PC in school.

### Dave
Dave is your run-of-the-mill coder. He can't draw to save his life, so he has resorted to low resolution *pixel art* because this way the chances of him achieving something half decent-looking are way higher than those of an armless monkey painting the Mona Lisa.

In addition to producing *charming programmer art*, Dave **codes**. In fact, that's what he does **90%** of the **16 hours a day** he stares at a computer screen. He knows more programming languages and frameworks than it would be reasonable for *any* human being. And every day he's learning 2 or 3 more, as if his nerd cred is going to get lower or anything.

Nevertheless, Dave is a nice chap overall. Too bad he's a **filthy**, **filthy** computer nerd and will never be able to appreciate simple pleasures of everyday life, like fresh air caressing his cheeks, sunlight bathing his skin or face-to-face human interaction for more than a few seconds every other week.

Anyway, his interest in **Sprite Hut** has its roots in the fact that it works in GNU/Linux, it's *hackable* and he can write his own plugins to export data to the 43 different game engines he tries in an average week.

### Tom
Tom is a professional animator. Sort of. Maybe. If you *do* consider Fl*sh users  professional animators.

He usually uses more powerful and bigger software for his animation work, but sees in **Sprite Hut** a nice little tool to import his artwork and export sprite sheets when he has some pending comission work for video games.

Plugin system
--

### Open issues:

* Use libpeas or roll our own?

#### Essential plugins:
* .spritehut save (builtin)
* .spritehut load (builtin)
* Image (frame by frame) import
* Image (frame by frame) export
* Sprite sheet import
* Sprite sheet export

#### Would be nice to have plugins:
* JSON data import
* JSON data export
* Open Raster (.ora) support

##### Sort of ridiculous, but why not?:
* H\*m\* beads pattern export by [*yours truly*](http://github.com/jjbernal).
* GBDK C export by [*Alejandro Seguí*](http://github.com/alesegdia)

## Non-goals

### For this milestone:
* Non-indexed color modes (16, 24, 32-bit, etc.)
* GIF import/export plugin.
* Seamless tile painting mode (like Krita).
* Integration of MyPaint or other advanced paint engine.
* Hyerarchycal/modular sprites support (like those in Rayman or Vectorman).

### Forever (or at least officially. *Feel free to fork if you need these features!*):
* Filters
* Advanced photo-retouching features
* Make-your-game-in-this-editor-with-no-coding-at-all
* 3D modelling
* Tweet this/Upload to facebook/whatever social media
* Linux kernel module (just in case)
